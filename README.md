## What is this?

PongRank is a simple leaderboard for your ping pong crew. Log matches, watch ratings rise and fall, and finally prove who's the real champion.

Uses **ELO rating** (same system chess uses) so upsets actually matter. Beat someone ranked higher? Big gains. Lose to a newbie? Ouch.

The "database"? Just a Google Sheet. No fancy infrastructure needed.

## Features

- **Leaderboard** — See who's on top
- **Match History** — Every game recorded
- **ELO Ratings** — Fair rankings that reward skill (and punish overconfidence)
- **Add Players** — Get everyone in the game

## For Developers

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
